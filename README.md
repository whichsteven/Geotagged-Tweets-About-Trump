# Geovisualization of Geo-Tagged Tweets About Trump

![heatmap_trump](/img/heatmap_trump.png)

This is a heatmap intended to visualize the global geographical distribution of the geo-tagged tweets that contain the keyword "Trump." The value of the color is proportional to the number of the tweets at the corresponding location.

From the map, we can see that most of the tweets are located in the United States, while some are in western Europe, some around India, and some in southwest Australia. The major concentration in the U.S. is probably because that U.S. citizens more tend to talk about the speeches made by thier president. Within the U.S., the tweets mostly locate in the coastal areas, possibly because these areas have higher population densities and better access to the Internet. After looking at the details of the tweets, I found that the high concentration of tweets around the state of Georgia is actually caused by one user sending multiple tweets with the same content, which could possibly be the behavior of a bot.

This visualization could be used for analyzing where people talk about Trump in their geo-tagged tweets. However, this visualization should be used with extra caution while making conclusions from it, because it has several limitations.

- People who do not have access to the required technology for twitter (for example, internet access or twitter account) are excluded from the data.
- The geo-tagged tweets included in this visualization were only collected a small period of time (less than 1 hour).
- Though the data were collected on a global scale, the time differences could lead to the different amounts of geo-tagged tweets sent at a certain time.
- Languages other than English could take "Trump" in other forms. The other forms of "Trump" were not collected.
- The tweets only include geo-tagged tweets. Many of the tweets do not have geo-tags.
- Bots might generate a large number of tweets within a very short time.
- "Trump" does not necessarily refer to U.S. President Donald Trump.
- There may still be many other limitations of the collected data.
